# DisTrackur
DisTrackur is a .py script made for information gathering off users on the Platform, Discord.  

# What does it do?
DisTracker as of right now has one purpose, and that is logging. </br>
As this script is made for more specific targets, one instance of this script logs all messages from the specified user. </br>
Obviously, it will work in dm's, groups, and (mutual) servers.

DisTrackur will also relay the time each message has been sent, along with storing all data in a .txt file, for accurate visualation.

# How to set it up?
DisTrackur is simple to set up. </br>
First git clone, or download the zip file and extract it onto your system. </br>
Next you will notice 3 .py (python) files. 'TARGETID', 'TOKEN', and the main file itself, 'DisTrackur'.

First you will need the discord token of the user your using to listen onto your target. (guide for retreiving your discord token is further down)  </br>
Next, you will open the 'TOKEN.py' file, and see an empty variable labled 'token'. This is where you will enter your discord token.
