# DisTrackur
DisTrackur is a .py script made for information gathering off users on the Platform, Discord.  

# What does it do?
DisTracker as of right now has one purpose, and that is logging. </br>
As this script is made for more specific targets, one instance of this script logs all messages from the specified user. </br>
Obviously, it will work in dm's, groups, and (mutual) servers.

DisTrackur will also relay the time each message has been sent, along with storing all data in a .txt file, for accurate visualation.

# How to set it up?
DisTrackur is simple to set up. </br>
First git clone, or download the zip file and extract it onto your system. </br>
Next you will notice 3 .py (python) files. 'TARGETID', 'TOKEN', and the main file itself, 'DisTrackur'.

First you will need the discord token of the user your using to listen onto your target. </br>
(guide for retreiving your discord token is further down)

Next, you will open the 'TOKEN.py' file, and see an empty variable labled 'token'. </br>
This is where you will enter your discord token. Now your user will read/run commands.

After that, you will need the user id of your target. Simply right click their username and </br>
'Copy ID'. Now open 'TARGETID.py', and paste the id in the empty variable, 'targetid'. </br>
NOTE: Do not quote the ID in the targetid.

Now you have your account, and the targets account linked to the script.  </br>
Simply just execute 'DisTrackur.py', and assuming everything went right, it'll start logging.
